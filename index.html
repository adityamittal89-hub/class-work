    <h2>ðŸ“° *Indiaâ€“USA Trade Tensions: A Shifting Economic Dynamic*</h2>
    
    <p>

The ongoing trade friction between India and the United States has stirred global attention, reflecting deeper shifts in international commerce and strategic priorities. Triggered by tariff hikes, market access disputes, and digital trade regulations, the tensions have exposed vulnerabilities in what was once a steadily growing economic partnership.<br /> The U.S. has raised concerns over Indiaâ€™s protectionist policies, while India has pushed back against what it sees as unfair trade practices and pressure on its domestic industries. Despite these challenges, both nations remain vital to each otherâ€™s economic ambitions, with bilateral trade crossing $190 billion in recent years. As negotiations continue, the world watches closelyâ€”hoping for a resolution that balances national interests with global cooperation, especially in sectors like technology, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture.
